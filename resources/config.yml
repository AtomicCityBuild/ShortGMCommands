# Thank you for using ShortGMCommands!
#
# The permission to use this plugin is
# just pocketmine.command.gamemode !
# Players without this default Gamemode 
# permission wont be able to use the
# commands.
#
# Please use " " for the messages.
# Otherwise it wont work
#
# Short information about the config file:
# when a new release is out and there are config file changes,
# you must delete the config file and restart the server!
# otherwise the new config options wont appear and you will 
# have problems with the messages in Game.
#
# (Too much text for just a config file of a small plugin
# like this, lets start the config :D)
